The previous AI engineer developed the Bike Tracker Alerts System, initially migrating its database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL Neon. The work progressed from fundamental backend functionalities like JWT authentication and Gmail synchronization to extensive frontend UI refactoring using  components for tables, calendars, and cards. Key feature implementations included flexible user/bike management, dynamic alert filtering, and a comprehensive bike history modal. Challenges addressed involved database migration specifics, ensuring consistent date filtering logic between frontend and backend, and adapting to user feedback (e.g., removing pagination for full alert display, refining date pickers). Recently, the focus shifted to resolving external deployment issues for Netlify and Vercel, involving detailed configuration for build processes, environment variables, and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

<product_requirements>
The product, Bike Tracker Alerts System, tracks bikes by syncing alerts from a configured Gmail account and presenting them via a dashboard. It's a React frontend, FastAPI backend application, which migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL Neon.

**Core Features & Improvements:**
*   **Authentication & Roles:** JWT-based login for admin and viewer roles. Admins have user CRUD; viewers have restricted UI. All users share the same alert/bike data.
*   **Database:** Successfully migrated to PostgreSQL Neon. The system is configured to depend *only* on Neon.
*   **Gmail Integration:** Syncs bike tracker alerts from Gmail. This functionality must remain intact.
*   **Alert & Bike Tracking:** Displays paginated (initially, then removed) alerts grouped by bikes. Alerts now show a full list (up to 5000). New alerts bring the associated bike to the top.
*   **Bike History:** Modal displays alert history (newest first) for a specific bike, allowing note CRUD with author attribution.
*   **Filtering:** Frontend-only date filtering, refined to use a  Date Range Picker in a popover, comparing exact  from the backend (date part only). Apply Filter button explicitly triggers filtering.
*   **Alert Categorization:** Categorizes alerts (e.g., Light Sensor, No Communication, Over-turn, Heavy Impact). Crash Detected requires over-turn AND heavy impact for the same bike, with a prominent pop-up.
*   **UI/UX:** System-wide dark mode. Major UI refactor to  for tables, cards, and calendar components.
*   **Codebase Cleanliness:** User requested removal of unused code and files to maintain a clean, understandable project.
*   **Deployment Readiness:** User explicitly requested assistance in deploying the application to external platforms like Netlify and Vercel, including necessary configuration adjustments and troubleshooting.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the user was encountering deployment issues on Vercel, specifically a recurring No FastAPI entrypoint found error (Chat 226), despite prior attempts to configure for Netlify. The AI engineer had just created a  file in the root directory (Chat 228) as a response to this error, likely to provide Vercel with explicit instructions on how to find the backend entrypoint () or configure its build/runtime environment. This follows a series of efforts to make the application deployable on Netlify, which included adding  and  for frontend builds, and configuring CORS in  to allow the Netlify domain () to interact with the backend (https://alerttracker-3.preview.emergentagent.com). The core application functionality (UI refactor, full alert list, date filtering) has been significantly updated and internally tested.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Explain the purpose of the newly created  and provide instructions on how to use it for Vercel deployment, then confirm if the user wishes to continue focusing on Vercel or revisit Netlify.
